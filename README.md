## Introduction

The "Apprenticeship Program Pernix GH Sample" project is a learning resource aimed at teaching the fundamentals of version control using Git and GitHub.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Introduce the basics of Git, including cloning repositories, making commits, and pushing changes.
- Familiarize participants with GitHub workflows, such as forking repositories, creating branches, and submitting pull requests.
- Provide hands-on experience with common Git commands and best practices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **Git**: Installed on your local machine. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **GitHub Account**: Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/).
- **Basic Command Line Knowledge**: Familiarity with command-line interfaces (CLI) is helpful.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository's GitHub page to create a copy under your account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/apprenticeship-program-pernix-gh-sample.git
    cd apprenticeship-program-pernix-gh-sample
    ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work to keep changes organized.

    ```

4. **Make Changes**: Add, edit, or remove files as instructed in the exercises.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Save your changes with a descriptive commit message.
